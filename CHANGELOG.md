# Changelog

All notable changes to UltimateXR will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

TODO: Write update guide:
  -UxrApplyConstrainEventArgs new properties.
  -Rename CheckAndApplyLockHands() to KeepGripsInPlace()
  -Removed UxrGrabbableObject.PlaceOnAnchor
  -SDK constants moved from UxrManager to UxrConstants.
  -Component synchronization in UxrManager now uses IUxrStateSync instead of
   UxrComponent.
  -UxrComponent.TryGetComponentById now is UxrUniqueIdImplementer.TryGetComponentById().
  -UxrManager.ExecuteStateChange is now called ExecuteStateSyncEvent.
  -Avatar prefab that is set up using UxrNetworkManager inspector, now is changed
   to "Update Externally" mode so that it is instantiated using external mode by default.
   Then it will switch to local if the avatar spawned is the local avatar.

### Added

- Add native multiplayer support and connectors for various network SDKs
  (Photon Fusion, Unity NetCode, Mirror) and voice communication SDKs
  (Photon Voice, Dissonance). More connectors will be added soon.
- Add UxrNetworkManager and UxrInstanceManager to provice sync capabilities.
- Update SDK Manager window with new tabs for SDK types, including new multiplayer.
- Add new GlobalSettings accessible using the Tools->UltimateXR Unity menu.
- Add new unique ID functionality to UXR components. All components that inherit
  from UxrComponent will have a unique ID that can be used with
  UxrUniqueIdImplementer.TryGetComponentById().
- Add new Unique ID generation tool to generate unique IDs for projects build with
  earlier versions of UltimateXR.
- Add IUxrUniqueId, IUxrStateSync and IUxrStateSave interfaces to UxrComponent to
  facilitate multiplayer synchronization, serialization, state saves and replay
  functionality in all UltimateXR components.
- Add UxrUniqueIdImplementer, UxrStateSaveImplementer and UxrStateSyncImplementer
  to leverage the interface implementation in custom user classes that cannot
  inherit from UxrComponent due to multiple inheritance limitation.
- Add functionality to UxrManager to save and load the scene state using
  SaveStateChanges() and LoadStateChanges().
- Add functionality to UxrManager to have a single point of entry to all component
  state changes that require synchronization:
  ComponentStateChanged event and ExecuteStateChange() method.
- Add serialization/deserialization methods to all UxrComponent derived classes.
- Add serialization/deserialization methods to all UxrSyncEventArgs.
- Create UxrVarType to enumerate all supported var types that can be synchronized.
- Add ToString() to all UxrSyncEventArgs to help data logging.
- Add new property Options to UxrSyncEventArgs to tell whether the event should
  be synchronized in different environments such as networks or replays.
- Add new BinaryWriter and BinaryReader extensions with functionality to
  serialize/deserialize Unity and UltimateXR data, as well as well-known
  C# types.
- Add new UxrBinarySerializer with binary serialization and deserialization support.
- Add new UxrSyncObject component to identify objects that don't have any
  UxrComponent added, so that they have a unique ID. Also to sync the Transform
  of a GameObject if it's required and no other component does it already.
- Add new interpolators to Math namespace to interpolate different types of
  variables using optional smooth and step options.
- Add support to solve manipulations on objects using an unlimited amount of
  grabs to support multi-user shared interaction.
- Add support to grab grabbable parent objects through grabbable children.
- Add support for dummy grabbable parents. Dummy grabbable parents are grabbable
  objects that can be manipulating only through the children, but still have
  position/rotation constraints.
- Add new functionality ForceSnapPosition and ForceSnapRotation to
  UxrPlacementOptions to force snap even if the grabbable object isn't set up
  that way.
- Add new functionality in UxrGrabManager to move grabbable objects considering
  constraints: SetLocalPositionUsingConstraints(), SetLocalRotationUsingConstraints(),
  SetLocalPositionAndRotationUsingConstraints(), SetPositionUsingConstraints(),
  SetRotationUsingConstraints() and SetPositionAndRotationUsingConstraints().  
- Add new UxrAutoSlideInObject/Anchor components to provide built-in functionality
  like how the battery in the example scene can be inserted/removed smoothly
  from the generators.
- Add new UxrGrabbableResizable component to provide functionality to create
  objects that can be scaled by grabbing them from both sides.
- Add new ComponentProcessorWindow editor base class to generate component
  processors that can modify from single components to the whole project.
- Add UxrEditorUtils.ProcessAllProjectComponents() functionality to process both
  innermost and non-innermost prefab elements.
- Add UxrEditorUtils.ModifyComponent() to perform changes to components in the
  scene or project separately processing instances, prefab variants and original
  prefabs.
- Add automatic detection of UXR installation path.

- Add new cabinet prefab to Lab in example scene to showcase grabbable parent dummies.
- Expose properties in UxrTeleportSpawnCollider to have public access.
- Add support for Meta Quest 3S.

- Improve manipulation workflow to a system that is more scalable, robust and
  solves the whole interaction process in different stages.
- Separate UxrGrabManager in different files based on functionality.
- Remove all properties from UxrApplyConstrainEventArgs leaving only GrabbableObject.
  Constraints are applied on an object level so it doesn't make sense to use grabbers,
  especially in multi-user environments.
- Remove RequireComponent attribute from UxrGrabbableObjectComponent that forces
  a UxrGrabbableObject component on the same GameObject. GrabbableObject can be
  required or not depending on overridable property IsGrabbableObjectRequired.
- Rename IsOwnershipChanged in UxrManipulationEventArgs to IsGrabbedStateChanged.
- UxrGrabPointShape now gets additional grabberDistanceTransform to also use
  non-default grabber proximity transforms.

  to anchor's parent when removing from anchor without grabbing.
- Move SDK constants from UxrManager to UxrConstants.
- Move input/tracking SDK locators from UltimateXR/Editor/Sdks to
  UltimateXR/Editor/Sdks/InputTracking.
- Add teleportation validators to UxrTeleportLocomotionBase to create custom logic
  for destination validation and cancel a teleportation.
- Move AvatarMoving and AvatarMoved events to UxrAvatar as GlobalAvatarMoving and
  GlobalAvatarMoved static events.
- Change Teleported event in UxrTeleportSpawnCollider to use new
  UxrTeleportSpawnUsedEventArgs parameter.
- Change UxrComponent unique ID functionality so that IDs are generated in the
  editor instead of using unique paths in scene with ComponentExt.GetUniqueScenePath().
- Improve avatar arm rig reference solving for hierarchies with siblings in
  the clavicle, upper arm or forearm.
- Change GetUniqueScenePath in ComponentExt and TransformExt to make it cleaner.
- Move AlignWindow, LookAtWindow and MirrorWindow tools to new namespace/folder in
  Editor/Utilities/TransformUtils.
- Improve UxrEditorUtils.Prefabs functionality.
- Improve TaskControllers documentation and functionality.
- Improve UxrLookAt component with new axis functionality.
- Make UxrControllerTracking's properties UpdateAvatarLeftHand/UpdateAvatarRightHand
  public instead of protected.
- Allow UxrTeleportLocomotionBase to be disabled to ignore the component.

### Fixed

- Fix UxrCameraPointer's ClickInput to Everything by default instead of None to avoid
  clicking each frame.
- Fix bug in UxrPointerInputModule that prevents pointer up notifications being
  generated when the finger tip/pointer is dragged out of the UI.
- Fix child dependent grabbable objects not being dynamic when releasing.

  Transform references are not set. When references are null, the Transform of the
  GameObject where the UxrTeleportSpawnCollider is added should be used instead.
- Fix UxrEditorUtils.ProcessAllProjectComponents() not processing all components
  correctly.
- Fix UxrEditorUtils.GetInnermostNon3DModelPrefabRoot() not working on all
  prefab/instance hierarchies correctly.
- Fix UxrEditorUtils.GetInnermostNon3DModelPrefabRoot() to handle 3D model prefabs
  correctly.

- Fix warnings in example scene when loading ShotgunPump01.mp3 and ShotgunPump02.mp3
- Fix missing EditorGUI.EndProperty() in UxrAxisPropertyDrawer.
- Move UxrLaserPointerTargetTypes to correct namespace UltimateXR.UI instead of
  root UltimateXR namespace.
- Fix UxrGrabPointShapeAxisAngle to compute center of grab correctly using snap point
  instead of using axis center.
- Implement missing minAngle and maxAngle functionality in UxrGrabPointShapeAxisAngle.
- Fix HandPositionAroundPivot manipulation mode drifting when grabbable object is
  child of another grabbable object.
- Fix preview grab poses to work on hierarchies with non-uniform scaling.
- Fix Lock Body Pivot parameter drifting in UxrStandardAvatarController.
- Fix bug in UI system to detect fingertip presses correctly in a moving canvas.
- Fix bug in UxrAvatar.LocalAvatar where a disabled avatar can be returned when
  there are two or more instances of an avatar with Local update mode in the scene.
- Fix bug in manipulation system where throwing physics-driven objects sometimes
  has a small lag between the button release and the physics.
