UltimateXR has high quality controller 3d models for all the supported devices.
When the avatar rendering is switched to "controllers" render mode in the UxrAvatar component, the currently connected controllers are rendered with optional virtual hands mimicking the user input.

Together with the manufacturers, we are currently finalizing the legal terms to include these assets in the framework. As soon as this process is finalized, all controllers will be made available in the update thereafter.
